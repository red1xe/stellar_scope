# StellarScope
StellarScope is a mobile application built using Flutter that aims to teach children and anyone interested in learning about our solar system. The main page of the app displays the planets of our solar system, and when the user clicks on a planet, the app displays details about it. Additionally, the app allows users to search for astronomical objects and view information about them.

## Features
The main features of StellarScope are:

* Solar System Planets: The main page of the app displays the eight planets of our solar system. The user can click on any planet to view its details, including its name, distance from the sun, and some interesting facts. The data for the planets is obtained using the API from http://api.le-systeme-solaire.net/.

* Astronomical Object Search: The app allows users to search for astronomical objects and view information about them. Users can search for objects such as stars, planets, and galaxies, and view details such as distance, mass, and other interesting facts.
